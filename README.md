VV285 Term Proj, SU2018.

The objective of this project is to understand and analyze the optical phenomenon about caustic in
the coffee cup. We start our work from the theoretical stage. In this stage, we initially recall the reflection
theorem of light and photon density as basic background of our project. By analyzing the envelop of
the family of curves, we figure out the formation of a nephroid and cardioid. Based on these analysis we
achieve the visibility of caustic finally in practical stage. Our visibility includes two parts. One part is
achieved by software simulation and the other is a practical experiment.
Based on the theoretical stage and practical stage, we figure out the formation of caustic in coffee
cup and analyze this kind of optical phenomenon by applying mathematical method. Finally, we also
prove this optical phenomenon by an experiment, which help us validate the formation of caustic better.
